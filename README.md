My GitHub account has the username @bossybeluga. 
The repository I created was made to house code and the revision history of each file. 
I downloaded the GitHub desktop version and then cloned my repository by choosing the repository I wanted to clone (bossybeluga.github.io) and then I chose the file in which the clone would reside.
