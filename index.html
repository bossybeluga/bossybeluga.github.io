    <h1>My name is Savannah!</h1>
    <p>I am a girl who loves to explore the beauty of nature 
      and express myself through various forms of art. I enjoy spending my free time walking, 
      camping, reading, writing, playing music and listening to music. As a full-time high school student, 
      I am also passionate about learning new things and pursuing my academic goals.</p>
